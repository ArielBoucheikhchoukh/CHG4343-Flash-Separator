This is where all files associated with Apache POI will go.

How to set up the Apache POI API:
1) In Dr. Java, click on 'Edit' in the toolbar, then 'Preferences'.
  Edit --> Preferences
  
2) Under 'Resouce Locations' in the 'Categories' box, click the 'Add' button under the 'Extra Classpaths' listbox.
  Resouce Locations --> Add
  
3) Go to the ApachePOI folder, and select all of the .jar files. This will add additional class paths to Dr. Java.

Currently, the code will only work with Excel 2007 or later.

I got the binary .zip file from here ---> https://poi.apache.org/download.html
